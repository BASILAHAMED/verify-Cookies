# Cookie Verification with Selenium

### Verify Cookies üîê

This script utilizes Selenium to interact with a web page, facilitating the logging in and logging out processes while checking cookies before and after these actions. This code is instrumental in understanding how a website's cookies evolve as a user undergoes the login and logout processes. Cookies often store session-related information, and their values might change dynamically based on user interactions with the website.

## Code Breakdown

**Initialization:**
- Sets up a WebDriver using Selenium tailored for Chrome.
- Implicitly waits for a maximum of 10 seconds for elements to appear on the page.

**`fetch_cookies()` Method:**
- Opens the specified URL (https://www.saucedemo.com/).
- Maximizes the browser window.
- Prints the cookies before the login process.
- Enters a username and password, then clicks the login button.
- Prints the cookies after the login process.
- Clicks on the burger menu and logs out.
- Prints the cookies after the logout process.

**`shutdown()` Method:**
- Closes the browser session.
